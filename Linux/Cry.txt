Steps to Make the Program in Linux

1) Learn GTK+
2) Cry because I have to reimplement it again
3) Ponder whether I should reimplement it because I could care less about Linux
4) Realize that Mac OS development sucks infinitely times more and cry more
5) Get over myself and implement it anyways because at least it's not as bad as Mac OS
